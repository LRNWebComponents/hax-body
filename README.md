# HAX
An application that uses HAX is made up of several custom elements working together. These elements are:
```
<hax-body>
<hax-panel>
<hax-manager>
<hax-source>
<hax-store>
```

These elements all live at the "app level" that you will create in order to utilize these tags. They are separate so that you can swap them out or fork individual ones as you desire.

## Definitions
- *HAX* - Headless Authoring eXperience or HAX, will always and must always be system agnostic. It needs to be able to interface with HTML primatives as well as custom-element tags which provide a haxProperties object to the specification of a haxElement.
- *HAX Element* - a sanitized simple object representation of a DOM node. HAX Elements can be translated into full DOM nodes easily because they express tag, properties and content. The element also allows for easy manipulation of an item prior to it ever existing in the DOM. Here's an example of a HAX Element to illustrate (using video-player as an example).
```
{
    "tag": "video-player",
    "properties": {
        "source": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzH4seWf8rQ"
        "responsive": false
    },
    "content": ""
}
```
- [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) - is a way of expressing the validation and input of properties in a JSON object, using a JSON object to express it (yeah.. I know..). What this affords us is a way of automatically generating form fields to modify the custom element fields that have been defined in the haxProperties object. This relationship can be seen in the hax-preview element which will map haxProperties to JSON Schema in order to generate an input form for the element. A fork `eco-json-schema-form` is providing all form capabilities to interface with the schema.
- *haxProperties* - an object that lives on a HAX capable element, expressing the way to build forms in HAX to modify it's options. This object expresses a default HAX Element, some minor booleans for UI areas, and the `settings` object which defines the field / property mapping for the `quick`, `configure` and `advanced` forms.
  - quick settings - these appear on the bar in place when an element has focus in hax-body
  - configure settings - these appear on the hax-preview form by default. Think of these as your primary means of modifying this "content type" so to speak, if the custom element were a unique piece of content to the system
  - advanced settings - things outside the norm as well as the "source view" if that boolean has been set
- *Gizmo* - A gizmo is a custom element placed in the page that provides advanced functionality. This could be a calendar widget, or a pdf-element, or a video-player, or really anything beyond a primative. This is effectively our silly name we use to communicate to end users adding something cool.
- *Stack* - A stack is a series of hax-blox, HTML primatives, and custom elements. Think of it like a "template" in other systems. It's just stamping down a series of things which can then be modified on their own. It's meant to be forked and not maintained after stamping. An example could be a standard page layout with an image justified to the right and broken out into three paragraphs.

## element scope / definitions
- `<hax-body-behaviors>` - any element that wants to be wired to HAX (in the polymer universe) should use hax-body-behaviors in order to provide consistency of property names, functions and utility functions.
- `<hax-body>` - the body area that all of the magic happens within. This is the thing providing the content for manipulation and injection of things.
  - `<hax-blox>` - a layout element that can help group the elements with in it
  - `<hax-ce-context>` - figures out the options for a custom element by reading off of the haxProperties object on the custom element.
    - `<hax-input-mixer>` - handles the data binding / form element type for an in-place change. This helps the "quick" options actually have an authoring UI
  - `<hax-iframe-context>` - quick context menu for the iframe primative
  - `<hax-image-context>` - quick context menu for the img primative
  - `<hax-text-context>` - quick context menu for anything that is valid yet doesn't have a dedicated menu. This would be things like p, blockquote, code, h[1-6].
  - `<hax-plate-context>` - a grid-plate editor which allow for cloning the item, moving it up or down in the hax-body DOM or deleting the element from the body
  - `<hax-context-item>` - an icon button for any hax-*-context menus which emmits normalized events and provides display consistency
  - `<hax-context-item-textop>` - same as hax-context-item but this is specific to text-based operations. If the event needs to maintain focus on the element's contenteditable area in order to work (like injecting a bulleted list) then this button helps ensure that happens. It works in all the same ways otherwise.
  - hax-context-item-menu>` - providing a consistent drop-down menu in place
- `<hax-panel>` - side panel of options to pick from as a form of quick inserting and selection of HAX Elements that get inserted into hax-body.
  - `<hax-panel-item>` - an item that lives in hax-panel and helps provide visual consistency as well as normalized event bubbling
- `<hax-manager>` - modal that's doing the bulk of the work of finding and configuring an element before it is placed on the page
  - `<hax-source-browser>` - a listing of all hax-sources in a "app store" type display
    - `<hax-source-browser-item>` - an item in this listing, generated based on reading off the information provided by hax-source
  - `<hax-preview>` - the "configure" screen of hax-manager which shows an interactive preview of what your working on and tweaking
- `<hax-source>` - an end point that has a listing of items (like videos) which also expresses
- `<hax-store>` - a state management object store as well as brain for what elements and sources are available to this HAX application. For example, if you place a `<video-player>` tag inside the `<hax-store>` element on the page, it will realize that video-player is a valid element, import it's definition at run-time (lazy load) as well as start to build up HAX defintion of what elements are available in the `<slot>`. It also provides global transformation methods for things like HaxPropertiesToJSONSchema and HAXElementToNode. This is the brain helping everyone else have to do less.

## Interaction flow
User clicks an edit button of some kind to enable HAX by placing hax-body into edit-mode (property). The user then can either click on elements currently in hax-body or to add new elements, click in hax-panel. As hax-body is pretty self contained, we won't express what's going on there but you can see how the different context menus place themselves correctly on active element and maintain wiring between the element and form properties.

### hax-body to hax-manager flow
The only meaningful interaction between hax-body and app level elements is that if `<hax-ce-context>` is being displayed for a custom element and the user clicks the settings button, it will open the `<hax-manager>` tag to the `<hax-preview>` element and open to the configure page. If the user hits update it'll update the selected item in the DOM with their modifications.

### Adding new things via hax-panel
User clicks on an item in `<hax-panel>` to add something to the interface, event bubbles up for `hax-item-selected` event which the app notices. The app can then tell `<hax-body>` to insert a simple HAX Element if it's an HTML primative (p, h2, blockquote, hr sorta thing) OR, if it's a call for a Gizmo and then it invokes `<hax-manager>` to open after resetting it to it's default state.

The user then selects if they want to Add material or Browse sources of gizmos. Browsing pulls up the `<hax-source-browser>` which provides a searchable list of sources in an "App store" style format. "Search Gizmos".

If an gizmo source is selected (we'll say Youtube). It opens a collased area which has search / filter capabilities for that source. The user searches for something, and then clicks on the thing they want to make. Now, the interaction transitions to hax-preview but let's detour quickly and talk about what happened there.

`<hax-source>` said "I have a HAX element" and bubbles up a hax-source-selected event to the app. The app saw the event and handled it (so it can do custom stuff if needed) and then told `<hax-manager>` "hey, here's your active thing" which then shifts it forward to the configure step of the operation. As part of this, it will then pass in an element in HAX Element format which `<hax-preview>` will unpack into the real thing.

### hax-preview
This is our form / modification area. hax-preview takes a HAX Element, reads off it's haxProperties object, and then converts it into JSON Schema to generate a form for editing via `<eco-json-schema-form>`. Preview then converts the HAX Element into a DOM node to render a preview and data binds it to the form. Now as the user edits fields in the form, it'll update the preview.

Once the user likes what they see, they hit embed and it'll convert the preview DOM node into a HAX Element and bubble up an event to insert it into `<hax-body>` via the app. At this point, `<hax-manager>` is triggered to close and we've effectively gone end to end.

## Saving
There's a function on `<hax-body>` called `haxToContent` which will strip all the hax specific tags and meta-data off of the DOM nodes in `<hax-body>`'s `<slot>` area and then returns the raw HTML.

And we've done it! Now we can ship this off to a back-end to do whatever we need to in order to save this.
