        are the largest predatory fish on Earth. They grow to an average of 15 feet in length, though specimens exceeding
        20 feet and weighing up to 5,000 pounds have been recorded. They have slate-gray upper bodies to blend in with the
        rocky coastal sea floor, but get their name from their universally white underbellies. They are streamlined, torpedo-shaped
        swimmers with powerful tails that can propel them through the water at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour. They can
        even leave the water completely,<lrn-vocab term="breaching"><video-player source="https://youtu.be/4EojXTOtNTA"></video-player></lrn-vocab>like whales when attacking prey from underneath.
