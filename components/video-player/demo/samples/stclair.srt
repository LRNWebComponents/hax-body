1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,060
You can't, like, punch things in a computer and 

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,110
have a hat pop out.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,160
You know, it has to be done by hand.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,260
And so artisans who work in the theatre, like

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,410
we train here at Penn State, are valuable everywhere.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,450
Our kids go right into the industry because we're teaching them

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,570
these skills that people need desperately, which is kind of wonderful.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,750
This past summer

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,840
we didn't have a first year group of grad students and we decided

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,010
we weren't going to London for one year, so I had like one year that I could do this.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,190
There was only once chance.

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,280
And so I started in August making inquiries of the university of Bournemouth, and I said,

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,400
"I have these skills and I've made a lot of hats, but we're doing a production of Titanic

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,570
and I would like to learn bigger hats, and things that

15
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,650
would be more of the period of 1910, which I've never done."

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,710
I brag about it all the time here because for two weeks I got to do one thing only.

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,780
and sit at a table for 10 hours a day making hats, and just 

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,910
really concentrate on learning a new skill, which was really fantastic.

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,960
It's almost like they want to be born and have their own

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,000
ideas about what they want to be. Even hats that I start, they don't necessarily end up

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,130
being what I thought they were when I started when they finish.

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,150
They had these purple velvet flowers which I thought were really fabulous, so I thought, "ok, 

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,250
I'm going to do something in the purple range." And then in one of the fabric stores in Shepherd's Bush I found

24
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,290
this fabulous black and purple stripe that became the

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,370
bow and the edging on this, and then we had to find another fabric and we thought this went like really

26
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,560
nicely with it. 

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,610
My parents were both teachers, and so

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,720
I was that kid that was in the library that they'd say, "why don't you go out on the playground?"

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,730
And I was so happy in the world of books and whatever, and sometimes I'll get a job and

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,860
I literally skip to the library, cause like, oh my god, I'm going to go today and research

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,890
Vivien Leigh today, and I was like the happiest kid on the planet that day.

32
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,990
And so history is huge.

33
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,020
I have to be sort of knowledgeable about psychology, and relationships, and

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,160
history, and art history, and world history.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,330
And you have to have kind of a knowledge of all of these things to understand

36
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,380
the period of what we're doing.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,490
We have people in my department who make these beautiful silk dresses, these beautiful delicate things.

38
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,670
I'm much more like I get to roll up my sleeves and muscle this stuff into place, 

39
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,750
fight it into place and put a wire in it, and make this really solid thing that will last through the run of a show.

40
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,780
I like that better, actually. I could make a dress, it wouldn't be pretty and there would be a 

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:03:06,133
lot of cursing involved, but this I love.
