[[vaadin-split-layout.limits]]
= Size Limits

By default, the user can resize the split until one of the content elements is collapsed.

You can set the limit for the resizing and prevent collapsing of the content elements by specifying a `min-` or a `max-` style property corresponding to the layout: `min-width` and `max-width` have effect for the horizontal layout, `min-height` and `max-height` for the vertical layout.

It is usually enough to set the limits on just one content element, either a first one or a second one.
