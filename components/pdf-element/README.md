[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/streetturtle/pdf-element)

Web component built with Polymer which allows to view PDF documents.  
Note that this element doesn't use browser's built-in PDF rendered, but rednders PDF using Mozilla's [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) library, which let's you have more control on how the document is displayed and which actions are available to user.
