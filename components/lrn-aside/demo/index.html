            Nick Neddo refers to himself as the Organic Artist and has written a book by the same name. The Organic Artist by Nick Neddo is a pretty cool book and he shows you how to make ink pens (including a kind of marker), brushes, berry inks, paint from minerals (rocks), etc. It is an awesome book to read--and his website is interesting to.
